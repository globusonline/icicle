# Welcome!

This is an experimental serverless search portal that introduces new ways to explore data in a Globus Search index.

## Visualizations

- [Treemap](/visualizations/treemap)


## `from-static` Improvements

To support this work, the following features are being explored in `@from-static`.

### Arbitrary Dependency Support
Implementation: [https://github.com/from-static/actions/pull/18](https://github.com/from-static/actions/pull/18)

This feature allows downstream projects to specify arbitrary dependencies in their `package.json` file. This is useful when the targeted `generator` does not include the desired dependencies.

This project is an example of this implementation based on its use of `d3` for many visualizations.


- `d3` was added to the `package.json` file in this project 
  â€“ [https://github.com/globusonline/icicle/blob/main/package.json#L4](https://github.com/globusonline/icicle/blob/main/package.json#L4)

- The `d3` package can then be referenced in `content` and `override` files.

For example, the following code has been added to **this** MDX page.

```js
import * as d3 from 'd3';

{(function(){
  console.log(d3);
}())}
```
import * as d3 from 'd3';

{(function(){
  console.log(d3);
}())}
